# RGB-Guessing-Game
This Game is very simple:
You get a RGB Color-Code and all you need to do is select the corresponding color:
The game currently has tow modes(Easy and Medium).

Preview of the Game in Medium Mode: ![Image of the Game, currently unavailable](Screenshots/Medium.PNG)

I built the game with HTML, CSS and plain JS, to improve my JavaScript skills. :D<br>
Have fun playing.
